	<h3>About Superlinks</h3>
	<p>
		Based on the idea of golinks, implemented in PHP and trying to stick to basics without the need for browser extensions.
	</p>
	<h3>Getting started with Superlinks</h3>
	<p>
		Usage should be very straightforward, enter <strong>go/anything</strong> as an address in your browser
		<ul>
			<li>If someone created a Superlink for "anything" accessible to you you will be redirected to it</li>
			<li>If multiple Superlinks that you can access exist for "anything" you will be shown a list of them</li>
			<li>If no Superlink exists for "anything" that you can access you will be prompted to create it</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Other options:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>go/add/anything&force</strong> - Force add a superlink for "anything" <strong>when it already exists</strong></li>
			<li><strong>go/action/list-own</strong> - List your Superlinks</li>
		</ul>
		The above assumes that 'go' is a valid hostname in a search domain on your computer or that go was explicitely set in your local hosts file.
	</p>
	<h3>Public access</h3>
	<p>
		If you set a Superlink to be "public" it can be accessed at https://{{ hostname }}/public/anything.
